by James Medel, May 1, 2019

## Files Submitted

- Jupyter notebook with code
- HTML output of the code
- A writeup report (pdf or markdown)

## Dataset Exploration

### Dataset Summary

`Submission includes basic summary of the data set`

### Exploratory Visualization

`Submission includes an exploratory visualization on the dataset`

## Design and Test a Model Architecture

### Preprocessing

`Submission describes the preprocessing techniques used and why these techniques were chosen`

### Model Architecture

`Submission provides details of the characteristics and qualities of the architecture`

includes the type of model used, the number of layers, the size of each layer.

Visualizations emphasizing the particular qualities of the architecture are encouraged.

### Model Training

`Submission describes how the model was trained`

Discuss what optimizer was used, batch size, number of epochs and values for hyperparameters.

### Solution Approach

`Submission describes the approach to finding a solution`

Accuracy on the validation set is 0.93 or greater

## Test a Model on New Images

### Acquiring New Images

`Submission includes five new German Traffic signs found on the web and visualized`

Discuss the particular qualities of the images or traffic signs in the images that are of interest, such as whether they would be difficult for the model to classify

### Performance on New Images

`Submission documents the performance of the model when tested on captured images`

The performance on the new images is compared to the accuracy results of the test set

### Model Certainty - Softmax Probabilities

`Submission discusses how certain or uncertain the model is of its predictions`

Top five softmax probabilities of the predictions on captured images are outputted

## Suggestitons to Make Your Project Stand Out!

### Augment the Training Data

### Analyze New Image Performance in More Detail

### Create Visualizations of the Softmax Probabilities

### Visualize Layers of the Neural Network
